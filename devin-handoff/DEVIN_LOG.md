# Coordination log

**Append-only. Never delete or rewrite a previous entry** — if something you logged turns out
to be wrong, add a new entry correcting it rather than editing history. Both Claude and Devin
read this file at the start of a session before touching `TODO.md` items, so it needs to be a
reliable record of what actually happened, not a polished summary.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <agent> — <short title>

**Item**: which TODO.md item (or "not in TODO.md" if it's a new finding)
**Status**: done / partially done / investigated-not-fixed / decided-not-to-do
**What changed**: files touched, one line each on the "why" (the diff shows the "what")
**Verified**: how you confirmed it actually works (live test, which account/data, what you
  checked) — "tests pass" alone is not sufficient for anything touching the multi-user/course
  logic; this codebase's real bugs have consistently been integration-level, not unit-level.
**New findings**: anything that changes what ARCHITECTURE_AND_COMPLETED_WORK.md says, even if
  small. If you found something wrong in that document, say so explicitly here — don't silently
  work around it.
**Left for later / handing back**: anything you deliberately didn't finish, and why.
```

## 2026-07-31 — Claude — Handoff created

**Item**: not in TODO.md — meta.
**Status**: done.
**What changed**: created this folder (`README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_AND_COMPLETED_WORK.md`,
`TODO.md`, `DEVIN_LOG.md`) to hand off context to Devin for parallel work, per the repo owner's
request. No application code touched.
**Verified**: n/a — documentation only.
**New findings**: n/a.
**Left for later / handing back**: everything in `TODO.md`, items 1-7. Item 6 (rebranding) is
explicitly blocked, not just unstarted.
